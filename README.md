# GitHubPracticeWithAyla
This is a repository made for the purpose of GitHub practice for my beautiful Ayla!
### Why I practice
-It is kinda cool.
### Things I am confused on.
- I still don't understand how the code gets transfered into how we "view" the code when it looks all pretty and nice. 
## Other stuff
- My husband is the best man that was ever born. He is kind, brave, funny, smarter than most people in any room with all of their IQs combined, he is also hot.
