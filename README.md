# GitHubPracticeWithAyla
This is a repository made for the purpose of GitHub practice for my beautiful Ayla!
## Why I do this- Ayla
- It's kinda cool.
# What confuses me
- I don't understand how the code turns into the tidy text that we read as the final product. Does it get eaten by a code monster and come out the other side all pretty and nice?
## Extras
- My husband is the best person that was ever born. He is kind, brave, funny, smarter that an entire room of people with their IQs put together. He is also hot.
